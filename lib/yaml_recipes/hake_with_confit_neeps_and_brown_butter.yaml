summary: This is an excellent winter meal, combining a classic Scottish ingredient with fresh fish and generous amount of butter

introduction:
  - "The neep (aka swede) is a classic Scottish ingredient most commonly associated with _haggis neeps and tatties_, the national dish. For this famous dish it's usually blended or crushed to a pulp with butter – much the same as one would make mashed potato – and it's really nice like this; the butter compliments the sweetness of the neeps, which are surprisingly sweet when cooked. I do, however, think it's underrated as an ingredient to be used in many other ways."
  - "Restaurant Mark Greenaway, one of the places I worked, used to serve _confit neeps_. The neeps were cut into chunky oblongs and then slowly cooked in clarified butter. They were served simply with a fillet of hake topped with a herb crust. My version of hake-with-neeps is an improvement on Mark's version, I think, because I sauteed the confit neeps before serving, to bring some vital caramelisation to the party. Combined with the crunchy skin of the pan fried hake, I think you'll agree it's pretty excellent!"
  - "As for the sauce, brown butter (beurre noisette) is an easy option for any kind of fish, and something I often turn to. It ended up being almost a _sauce grenobloise_ after I added chopped lemon and capers. I finished the garnish with some cavolo nero and brown shrimp."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 2 fillets of hake, about 150 g each
    - 1\2 medium neep (swede)
    - 2 medium leaves cavolo nero, chopped
    - 400 g unsalted butter
    - 2 slices of lemon, cut into 5mm dice
    - 1 tsp capers
    - 2 tsp brown shrimp
    - vegetable oil, for frying
    - sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper

method_steps:
  - "Place the fish out of the fridge to start coming to room temperature, and pat the skin dry with a cloth or a piece of kitchen towl. This will ensure it goes nice and crisp when you fry it."
  - "Cut of 60g of butter for making the sauce later, then clarify the rest of it: put it in a saucepan and place over a low heat until it the fat has separated from the milky part. Carefully pour of the fat into another pan, and discard the milky bit. Peel the neep and cut into chunky oblongs about 2cm thick. Immerse them in the clarified butter and place over a medium-low heat. Cook gently; don't allow the butter to get too hot otherwise the neeps will start to fry. Cook for about 20-30 minutes or until they are tender, then remove from the pan and allow to cool. Once cool, cut the oblongs into dice."
  - "Now cook the cavolo nero: place a saute pan or frying pan over a medium heat and add a splash of oil. When the oil is hot, add the cavolo nero along with a pinch of salt. Stir-and-fry for about 30 seconds, then add about half a glassful of water and put a lid on (use a piece of foil if you don't have a lid). Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until tender. Set aside."
  - "Now for the fish: place a heavy-based frying pan over a high heat and allow to get hot. Add 2 tablespoons of oil. Wait for the oil to get hot; about 30 seconds. Season the fish all over with salt, then place in the pan, skin side down. Press gently to ensure the skin makes good contact with the surface of the pan. Keep the heat high for 30 seconds, then turn down to medium. Cook like this for about 3 minutes. You should be able to see that the flesh of the fish is about 3/4 cooked. At thisd point, add the 60g of reserved butter from earlier, and allow it to foam. Baste the fish for 1 minute. The fish should be cooked at this point. You can check if it's cooked by inserting a skewer: it should give no resistance. Remove the fish and set aside."
  - "While the fish is cooking, fry the diced neep in a hot pan until caramelised, then set aside."
  - "To finish the sauce, add the capers, lemons and brown shrimp. To serve, place the cavolo nero in the centre of the plate and put the neeps on top, followed by the sauce."
