summary: This is my favourite bean recipe, hands down. And also one of my favourite curries

introduction:
  - "It never ceases to amaze me how delicious and savoury this meal is, being comprised of essentially just beans, tomatoes and a few spices. Well, quite a lot of spices, actually. As with many curry recipes, the ingredients list is quite long but the method is very simple. I would recommend measuring out all the spices beforehand into bowls from which they're added to the pot at the same time."
  - "This recipe is adapted from a red kidney bean curry by one of my food heros, and 'the godmother of Indian cooking', Madhur Jaffrey."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 225 g dried black turtle beans
    - 3 tbsp olive oil
    - 0.5 tsp whole brown mustard seeds
    - 0.5 tsp whole cumin seeds
    - 1 generous pinch asafetida
    - 15 fresh curry leaves
    - 3 medium tomatoes, coarsely grated or blended
    - 1/4 tsp ground tumeric
    - 1 tsp ground coriander
    - 1 tsp ground cumin
    - 2 red chillies, chopped
    - 1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
    - 1 tsp fresh root ginger, grated to a pulp
    - 1 tsp sugar
    - 1.5 tsp salt

method_steps:
  - "Firstly, soak the beans: cover generously with cold water and leave to soak overnight (you don't need to do this if you're using canned beans). Drain the next day, put in a medium-large pan, cover with water by about 1 inch and bring to the boil. Partially cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and cook gently for 2-2.5 hours or until the beans are tender. You may need to top up with water occasionally to ensure the beans are covered."
  - "Meanwhile, pour the olive oil into a medium pan and set over a medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, put in the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and asafetida. As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop, add the curry leaves and tomatoes. Stir once, then add the turmeric, coriander, cumin, chillies, garlic, ginger, sugar and salt. Stir and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for 5 minutes."
  - "When the beans are tender, pour the spiced tomato mixture into the pan with the beans. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, on a very low heat, for 20 minutes."
