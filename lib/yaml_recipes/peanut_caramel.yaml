  - "Nirvana for peanut butter lovers, this is a turbo-charged, silky sweet peanut spread"

  for the condensed milk:
    - 1 litre whole milk
    - 1 kg granulated sugar

third_ingredient_set:
  for the peanut caramel:
    - 150 g condensed milk
    - 80 g smooth peanut butter
    - 120 g invert syrup

method_steps:
  - "For the invert syrup, boil the water, then add the sugar and stir gently until dissolved. Simmer gently, without further stirring, until it reaches 125 C. Remove from the heat and allow to cool in the pan."
  - "For the condensed milk, bring the milk to a boil in a large pan, then add the sugar. Stir gently until dissolved, then simmer gently until it reaches 110 C, skimming frequently to remove any skin/film. Transfer to a bowl or container and allow to cool."
  - "To finish the peanut caramel, add all the ingredients to a pan and place over a medium heat. Stir gently to combine as it comes up to temperature, and continue stirring until it is only just simmering. Be careful to scrape the bottom of the pan so that it doesn't catch."
