introduction:
  - "The rich chocolate sponge of this cake is complimented beautifully by the decadent peanut caramel icing"
  - "For this recipe you'll need 2 x 23 cm (9 inch) diameter cake tins or rings."

first_ingredient_set:
  For the peanut caramel icing:
    - 200 g peanut caramel (1 jar)
    - 250 g unsalted butter, at room temperature
    - 150 g icing sugar, plus a little extra for the top

second_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 400 g caster sugar
    - 225 g plain flour
    - 65 g cocoa powder
    - 1.5 tsp baking powder
    - 1.5 tsp bicarbonate of soda
    - 1 tsp salt
    - 2 eggs
    - 250 ml milk
    - 110 g extra virgin olive oil
    - 2 tsp vanilla extract
    - 250 ml boiling water
    - 100 g peanuts, shelled and blanched

method_steps:
  - "Heat the oven to 275 C (525 F)."
  - "Mix the dry ingredients: place the caster sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda in a large bowl and stir with a whisk to combine. If you have a stand mixer, use the bowl for it."
  - "Take another bowl and add the eggs, milk, olive oil and vanilla extract to it. Whisk until smooth, then add to the bowl with the dry ingredients, mixing on medium speed using the paddle attachment. If you don't have a stand mixer, just mix by hand with a spoon. Mix for 2 minutes. Add the boiling water gradually, whilst continuing to mix thoroughly."
  - "Take the two cake tins and rub them with a little vegetable oil or butter, then lightly (and evenly) dust with flour. Divide the cake mixture into the two tins and place in the centre of the oven for 30 mins. They're done when a small knife or skewer can be inserted into the centre and be withdrawn with no cake mixture stuck to it. Remove from the oven and place on a rack to cool. Allow to cool for 20 minutes before removing from the tins."
  - "Turn the oven to 180 C (350 F). Spread the peanuts on a roasting tray and place in the oven for 10 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove from the oven and set aside."
  - "To make the peanut caramel icing, firstly whip or beat the butter until it's light and fluffy. You can use a kitchen stand mixer with the paddle attachment for this, or an electric hand whisk. If you don't have either of those, just beat it with a sturdy wooden spoon. Add the icing sugar using a sieve to remove any lumps, and add the peanut caramel. Mix until thoroughly combined."
  - "Once the two sections of the cake have completely cooled down, place one on the plate which you'll serve it from, then spread an even layer of the icing on the top using a spatula or pallet knife. You need to remember to leave enough icing for the top and the sides â€“ you'll want to use a little over one quarter of the icing for this middle bit. Place the second section of the cake on top, and spread the remaining icing evenly on the top and sides."
  - "Roughly chop the roasted peanuts and scatter them on top. Finally, dust a little icing sugar over the top using a sieve."
