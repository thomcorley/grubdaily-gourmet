summary: This is a novel way to serve couscous and it's so easy!

introduction:
  - "This is a novel way to serve cauliflower and it's so easy! Simply chop the cauliflower into small pieces, fry lightly in olive oil or rapeseed oil and season it with sea salt. It can be as simple as that, although I like to add a few more flavourings such as some soft fresh herbs, spring onions, fresh green chillies and kimchi."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 250 g cauliflower (about 1/2 a head)
    - 1 fresh green chilli (optional)
    - 1 tsp kimchi (optional)
    - 2 spring onions
    - 1 small handful coriander
    - 1 teaspoon chopped lemon
    - sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
    - 1 small handful spinach
    - fine quality rapeseed oil

method_steps:
  - "Remove the thick stem from the cauliflower and reserve for another recipe, or discard. Roughly chop into approx. 2 mm sized pieces. Roughly chop the chilli, spring onions, kimchi and coriander."
  - "Place a wide frying pan or pot and place over a medium-high heat. Add 2 - 3 tablespoons of rapeseed oil and, when the oil is hot (in about 20 seconds), add the chopped cauliflower along with a generous pinch of salt. Stir-and-fry until the cauliflower is just cooked. Try not to get any caramelisation on the cauliflower; if it begins to colour then turn the heat down. Be careful not to overcook it as it will become mushy."
  - "Remove from the heat and add the chilli, kimchi, spring onions, coriander, lemon and spinach. Stir well until the spinach is lightly wilted. Add a pinch of black pepper. Taste and add more salt if needed, then serve."
