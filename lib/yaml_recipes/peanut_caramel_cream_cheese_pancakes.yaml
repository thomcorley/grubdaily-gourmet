summary: Peanut Caramel and cream cheese go very well together, and make for a very luxurious filling for pancakes

introduction:
  - "Peanut Caramel and cream cheese go very well together, and make for a very luxurious filling for pancakes. For extra decadence, drizzle some melted jam into the mix. To top it off, scatter over some crushed salted peanuts fried in butter."

first_ingredient_set:
  for the pancakes:
    - 3 large eggs
    - 250 g plain flour
    - 450 ml milk
    - 1 pinch of sea salt
    - butter, for frying

second_ingredient_set:
  for the filling and topping:
    - 150 g cream cheese
    - 75 g Peanut Caramel
    - 3 tbsp jam, melted
    - 4 tbsp salted roasted peanuts
    - 1 tsp icing sugar

method_steps:
  - "Crack the eggs into a bowl, add the flour, a splash of the milk and salt. Mix until you have a perfectly smooth consistency. Now add the rest of the milk in stages, mixing to get a smooth texture in between each stage."
  - "Roughly chop or crush the peanuts and fry them with a little butter until golden, then set aside for later."
  - "To make the cream cheese filling, put the cream cheese and Peanut Caramel in a mixing bowl and stir until thoroughly combined. Place in the fridge whilst you make the pancakes."
  - "To cook the pancakes, get your frying pan nice and hot before adding a knob of butter. Once the butter has melted, pour in a ladleful of batter whilst carefully tilting the pan to ensure that a nice even spread is achieved. Fry for a few minutes on each side, until golden. Put on a plate in a low oven or plate warmer tray to keep warm whilst you cook the rest of the batch."
  - "To serve, spread about 2 tbsp of the cream cheese filling on each pancake, and a little drizzle of the melted jam. Roll the pancake up and optionally cut in half to serve before garnishing with the chopped roasted peanuts and a little dusting of icing sugar."
