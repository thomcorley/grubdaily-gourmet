summary: "Combining the perfect crunchy/chewy ratio with a surprising but delightful savoury undercurrent from the miso, to me these cookies are perfect"

introduction:
  - "The sweetness of Peanut Caramel combined with the salty savoury kick from the miso makes these cookies quite irresistible. If you're a fan of sweet-and-salty things, you'll love these cookies. Make sure not to overcook them – they're enjoyed best when slightly underdone, soft and tempting in the centre."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 225 g plain flour
    - ¾ tsp bicarbonate of soda
    - ½ tsp baking powder
    - 120 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
    - 250 g Peanut Caramel
    - 100 g light brown sugar
    - 75 g miso paste
    - 1 large egg
    - 1 ½ tsp vanilla extract
    - 100 g Demerara sugar, plus more as needed

method_steps:
  - "In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda and baking powder, and whisk until incorporated. Set aside."
  - "In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix butter, Peanut Caramel and light brown sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes."
  - "Add the miso to the mixing bowl, and continue to mix at medium speed, about 1 minute. Scrape down sides of the bowl to make sure all of the ingredients are evenly incorporated, and mix a bit more if needed. Add egg and vanilla extract, and mix until just combined."
  - "Add ⅓ of the flour mixture to the mixing bowl, and mix on low speed until flour mixture is incorporated. Repeat with remaining flour mixture in two batches until all of it is incorporated."
  - "The dough will have become quite soft at this point and likely be too sticky to handle. Place in the fridge or a cool place for 1 hour to allow it to firm up."
  - "Place the demerara sugar into a small bowl. Working with one piece at a time, scoop out about 2 heaped tablespoons of dough (about 50 grams per cookie), and roll each portion between your hands until it is nice and round. Drop the piece of dough into the bowl of Demerara sugar and turn to coat. Transfer each ball to a parchment-lined baking sheet, arranging them about 3 inches apart. Repeat with all of the dough."
  - "Refrigerate for 2 hours and up to overnight. (Even 15 minutes of refrigerator time will help the dough firm up, and the flavours meld.)"
  - "When ready to bake, heat oven to 175 C (356 F). Bake cookies for about 13 minutes, until crisp at the edges and slightly puffed in the middle. They should still be a bit underdone in the centre. Pull out the baking sheet and hit it against a counter. Place back into the oven to finish for about 3 to 4 minutes. When cookies are firm at the edges and slightly puffed in the centre, pull them out and again hit the baking sheet against the counter. The cookies should appear flat and crinkly at the centre."
  - "Let the cookies cool on a baking sheet for a few minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack. Store fully cooled cookies in an airtight container; they should retain their chewy texture for a few days."
