summary: This is a rich, deeply savory dal that's got a hint of smokiness.

introduction: 
  - Dal is the Indian name given to lentils or beans. In India you can find a huge variety, and many more delicious savory concoctions made from them. When I visited the country, I was astounded at the depth of flavour that could be found in  a _dal_; they were undeniably tasty, and had a powerful savoriness that I had previously thought wasn't possible in a dish with no meat.
  - As lentils and beans are relatively inexpensive, they are used in everyday meals for lunch and dinner. This dal, made from black _urid beans_ however, is a bit more special. Due to the toughness of these beans, they must be soaked for several hours, then slowly simmered over a gentle heat for several hours more. Of course, a customary mixture of garlic, onion and spices is added to the mixture, and the result is a dark earthy bean stew that has a hint of smokiness. It's very rich, there's no denying it, so I have finished it with a swirl of yoghurt and some freshly chopped coriander.

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 200g urid beans, soaked in water for at least 6 hours
    - 30g unsalted butter
    - 1 large onion, finely chopped
    - 5 cloves garlic, finely chopped
    - 20g root ginger, grated to a pulp
    - 3 tbsp tomato puree
    - 1 ¼ tsp salt
    - ½ tsp cayenne pepper
    - ¼ tsp ground asafoetida
    - 1 tsp ground coriander
    - 1 tsp ground cumin
    - ½ tsp garam masala

second_ingredient_set:
  to finish:
    - 15g unsalted butter
    - 1 bunch fresh coriander
    - 3 tbsp natural yoghurt

method_steps:
  - Drain the beans and rinse. Place in a pot and add water until just covered. Add ½ tsp salt, then bring to the boil, skimming off and discarding all the scum that rises. Simmer gently for 45 mins, topping up with water if necessary.
  - While the beans are simmering, add the 30g of butter to a separate pot and place over a medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the onions and ¼ tsp salt. Turn the heat to low and fry gently for 20 minutes until soft and sweet. Add the garlic and ginger and continue to cook for a further 5 minutes. Now add the tomato puree, cayenne pepper, asafoetida, ground cumin, ground coriander. Stir thoroughly and cook for a further 5 minutes on a low heat. Now add the beans, the remaining ½ tsp of salt 300ml water. Bring to the boil, then turn to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 hours, topping up with water if necessary. By the end, it should be dark in colour and fairly thick; almost but not quite as thick as porridge.
  - To finish, add the 15g butter and mix vigorously to thicken the dal. If, at this point, it seems too thick just add a splash of water. Mix the yoghurt in at the last second to create a marble effect. Roughly chop the coriander and scatter over, along with the garam masala.
