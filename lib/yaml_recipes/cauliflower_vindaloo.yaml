summary: "Vinegar is a key ingredient in a Vindaloo, and it’s possibly the cause of the Vindaloo’s fearsome reputation."

introduction:
  - "Cauliflowers are in season and I've spent the last few weeks doing some experimentation as a way of celebrating what I think is a rather underappreciated vegetable. A cauliflower is good for so much more than cauliflower cheese! Because it naturally has quite a savoury flavour, it is good in a curry. Think _aloo gobi_, a classic Indian curry made with potatoes (aloo) and cauliflower (gobi); an excellent flavour combination."
  - "The vindaloo is, and probably always will be, my favourite curry. A classic vindaloo is made with pork, but works great with chicken too. A [runner bean vinadloo](https://www.grubdaily.com/runner-bean-vindaloo) was a previous late-summer experiment of mine which was a fantastic and delicious succcess. I feel like this moment was inevitable; it is now time for the cauliflower to receive the vindaloo treatment."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 500 g cauliflower (about 1/2 a head)
    - 3 tbsp of high quality rapeseed oil
    - 80ml white wine vinegar
    - 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
    - 1 tbsp ground cumin
    - 1 tbsp paprika
    - 1 tbsp ground coriander
    - 1 tsp cayenne pepper
    - 1 1/2 tsp garam masala
    - 1/2 tsp brown mustard seeds
    - 1/4 tsp whole fenugreek seeds
    - 15 curry leaves
    - 2 medium onions, finely sliced along the grain
    - 2 tbsp fresh ginger, finely grated
    - 10 medium cloves of garlic, peeled and finely grated
    - 2 medium tomatoes, coarsely grated
    - 1 handful of baby spinach leaves
    - 1 tsp sugar
    - 1 tsp salt

method_steps:
  - "Remove the thick stalk from the cauliflower and reserve for another recipe. Separate into florets about 4 cm thick and then cut each one in half. Put a large, heavy based pan on a high heat and add the rapeseed oil. Wait for the oil to heat up. Season the cauliflower pieces with salt and place in the pan in a single layer (do them in batches if the pan is too small). Stir occasionally and allow the cauliflower to become golden and caramelised. Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate or a tray."
  - "While the chicken is browning, measure out the turmeric, cumin, coriander, paprika, cayenne pepper and garam masala and set aside in a bowl."
  - "Ideally, your pan will be big enough to cook the rest of the curry in it; if not, transfer all the oil from the pan into a larger one. Set the pan over a medium-high heat and add the mustard and fenugreek seeds. When the mustard seeds begin to pop, add the onions and curry leaves. Stir and fry until the onions turn a light golden brown. Add the ginger and garlic, and stir until fully mixed. Now add the spice mixture and tomatoes. Turn the heat down and continue to cook for around 5 minutes. "
  - "Add the cauliflower pieces to the pan along with the salt, sugar, and 350ml water. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 10 - 15 minutes or until the cauliflower is tender."
  - "Taste the curry and add more salt if necessary. Finally, add the baby spinach and stir until gently wilted. Serve with white rice."
