introduction: 
  - "Brambles, like most berries, are nicely paired with Peanut Caramel and this cake is an impressive thing to make for a dinner party, or even to just have on a casual weeknight if you have the time! The concept is quite straightforward: make a meringue and mix some Peanut Caramel into it before baking into flat circular pieces. Once cooked and cooled, these are stacked up with whipped cream, peanut caramel sauce and bramble comp√¥te between the layers. It's an irresistible combination and a really eye-catching centrepiece for your dessert course."
