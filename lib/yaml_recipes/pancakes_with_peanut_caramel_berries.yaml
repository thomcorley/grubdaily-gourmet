summary: Classic fluffy American-style pancakes, with Peanut Caramel sauce and berries


introduction:
  - "Classic fluffy American-style pancakes, with Peanut Caramel sauce and berries. If you're feeling lazy, you could
     buy ready-made pancakes from the shop, but I urge to make your own, it's worth the extra effort. The Peanut
     Caramel sauce is versatile for many things besides this, and it goes really well with any red or black berries."

first_ingredient_set:
  for the pancakes:
    - 200 g plain flour
    - 2 tbsp caster sugar
    - 1 tbsp baking powder
    - 1/4 tsp salt
    - 300 ml milk
    - 1 large egg
    - 70 g butter, plus a little more for frying

second_ingredient_set:
  for the filling and topping:
    - 8 tbsp mixed red and black berries
    - 150 g double cream
    - 75 g Peanut Caramel

method_steps:
  - "Melt the butter and set it aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, egg, and melted butter. Create a well in the center of your dry ingredients. Pour in the milk mixture and stir gently with a fork until the flour is just incorporated. A few small lumps are okay. As the batter sits, it should start to bubble."
  - "Fry the pancakes â€“ melt a knob of butter in a frying pan and wait for it to melt, then add the batter 1 tablespoon at a time, spreading it gently to form a circular pancake about 0.5 cm thick. Fry on a medium heat for 2 minutes on each side, or until golden. Cook the pancakes in batches, and keep warm in a low oven or plate warmer."
  - "To make the Peanut Caramel sauce, add the double cream and Peanut Caramel to a sauce pan and bring to the boil over a medium heat whilst whisking. Once it's boiling, remove from the heat and continue to whisk until smooth."
  - "To serve the pancakes, stack them up with Peanut Caramel sauce between the layers and top with the mixed berries."
