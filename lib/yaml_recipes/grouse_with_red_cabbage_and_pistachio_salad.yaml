summary: This salad is great with any kind of strong game bird, but is particularly good with grouse

introduction:
  - "This is a fantastic light dish to make during the grouse season. I've served this salad with a variety of game birds; it also works well with wood pigeon or any kind of duck. As per my philosophy when it comes to the legs of game birds, I've prepared them as a confit and mixed the flakey meat into the shredded salad. The rich saltiness of the leg meat adds flavour and texture to the salad., which is then finished with some crunchy pistachios and fresh vibrant mint leaves."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 2 whole grouse, oven ready
    - 4 rashers streaky bacon
    - 2 tsp coarse rock salt
    - 1/4 red cabbage
    - 2 medium carrots
    - 1/2 sweetheart cabbage
    - 1 tbsp pistachios, shelled
    - 1 small bunch mint leaves
    - extra virgin olive oil
    - white wine vinegar
    - sea salt and cracked black pepper

method_steps:
  - "Remove the legs from the grouse and place them in a tray or container just big enough to fit them in a single layer. Sprinkle them with rock salt â€“ the quantity is not vitally important but approximately a 1/2 teaspoon per leg is about right. Put them in the fridge for 6 - 8 hours. Don't leave them too long or they will become too salty."
  - "Heat the oven to 110C. Wash the rock salt from the legs under running water, then drain in a colander. Melt the duck fat in a casserole dish or saucepan, then place the legs in, making sure they are completely submerged. Place over a medium heat on the stove until the legs are starting to sizzle in the hot fat, then put in the oven. Cook until the meat is just falling off the bone. It will take approximately 2 hours, but will vary according to the size and tenderness of the legs. Remove from the fat and allow to cook slightly before picking the meat from the bone, being careful to remove any small bones or sharp filaments. Place the flaked confit meat in a container or bowl and set aside for later."
