summary: A simple, delicious and really easy way to prepare gnocchi

introduction:
  - "This was a quick lunch I made the other day with some leftovers I had in my fridge. Gnocchi looks great when prepared like this because you get a nice colour contrast from the dark caramelisation on the ridges of the gnocchi and the vibrant green from the spring cabbage and spinach. You will have a decent amount of bacon fat left in the pan after cooking the bacon lardons. This is perfect for frying the gnocchi in; they will soak up all that delicious salty grease."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 200 g gnocchi
    - 100 g bacon, cut into lardons
    - 1 clove garlic, sliced
    - 1 large handful spinach
    - 1/2 spring cabbage
    - sea salt and cracked black pepper
    - olive oil

method_steps:
  - "Place a large, heavy-based pan over a medium high heat and wait for it to get hot. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and when the oil is hot, in about 15 seconds, add the bacon lardons. Fry, stirring occasionally, until they are crisp and caramelised, then remove from the pan and set aside. Leave the bacon fat in the pan for frying the gnocchi."
  - "Add the gnocchi to the pan with the bacon fat and fry, stirring occasionally, until nicely browned."
  - "While the gnocchi is cooking, remove and discard the dark outer leaves from the cabbage then roughly chop the rest of it. When the gnocchi is done, remove from the pan and set aside, then add the cabbage and the garlic along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir-and-fry for about 30 seconds then add a splash of water. Continue to stir-and-fry until the cabbage is tender and the water all evaporated, then add the spinach. Stir until wilted, then add the bacon and gnocchi back into the pan. Stir to warm everything through, then serve."
