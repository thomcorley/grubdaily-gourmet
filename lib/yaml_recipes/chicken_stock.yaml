summary: The backbone of sauces, soups and countless other recipes, chicken stock is an essential thing to have in your larder

introduction:
  - "A good quality homemade chicken stock is the foundation for so many recipes, its importance in the kitchen could not be understated. My usual routine is to buy chicken every week, either a whole bird or just the legs, and unless I'm roasting it whole, I'll joint and de-bone it so I can use the wings, thighs and breast meat for different recipes, then make stock from the remaining bones and carcass. Cutting the bones and carcass up into small pieces first will allow more efficient extraction of flavour."
  - "Cooking for 2.5 hours or so will allow the bones to completely break down and yield the maximum amount of gelatin, giving the stock body â€“ especially useful when using it to make sauces that will be reduced in order to thicken them. Optionally, you could include the wing"
