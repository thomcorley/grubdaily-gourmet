summary: Similar to ice cream, this is a beautiful iced dessert to make at home

introduction:
  - "Similar to ice cream, this is a beautiful iced dessert to make at home, and can even be made as a substitute for ice cream if you don't have an ice cream machine. The texture is slightly softer and more mousse-like than traditional ice cream. Serve with some roasted peanuts and pistachios scattered over."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 7 egg yolks
    - 4 egg whites
    - 300 g caster sugar
    - 700 ml double cream
    - 200 g Peanut Caramel

method_steps:
  - "Measure out 200 g of the sugar into a bowl, and add the egg yolks (reserve the rest of the sugar for later)Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water, and whisk until thickened. It should form ribbons when lifting the whisk up. Be careful not to overheat, you don't want to scramble the eggs. Remove from the heat and set aside."
  - "In a separate bowl, add the egg whites. Whisk until soft peaks form, then gradually add the remaining 100 g of sugar, whisking continuously. Keep whisking until the sugar is completely combined."
  - "Measure out 450 ml of the double cream into another bowl, then whisk until stiff peaks form. Fold the egg white carefully into the whipped cream in three stages."
  - "Mix the peanut caramel with the remaining 250 ml of double cream and stir until thorougly combined, then add the egg yolk mixture from earlier. Now fold in the egg white and cream mixture in three stages. Stir or fold together until completely combined."
  - "The parfait mixture is now ready to freeze. If you're using it as ice cream, simply pour into a container and put in the freezer. If you want to make a parfait that you can slice, first line a terrine or loaf tin with a double layer of cling film before pouring in the parfait mix. Freeze for at least 6 hours before serving."
