summary: This soup is the perfect defence against the bitter coldness of midwinter

introduction:
  - "This soup is the perfect defence against the bitter coldness of midwinter, it'll both warm you up and warm the
     cockles of your heart. There's just a hint of spice to provide a little heat, but feel free ramp it up by
     adding more chillies. This recipe is based on a classic recipe by Marguerite Patten, an old school cook and
     one of the first celebrity chefs."
  - "The soup starts with a _soffrito_ â€“ onions and garlic cooked softly and gently for about 10 minutes. This
     gives a platform of sweetness for the rest of the ingredients to stand upon. It pays to fry the parsnips
     along with the spices in foaming butter at a high temperature before adding any liquid. This will generate
     some essential caramelisation which adds depth of flavour."
