summary: This is an excellent way to make the most of a glut of red cabbages in the winter season.

introduction:
  - "One of the best ways to make use of red cabbage, this coleslaw is really versatile and could be paired with almost any kind of meat or fish, pizza, pasta or just about anything you can think of. This one is a bit more interesting than your average coleslaw due to the addition of brown mustard seeds, fried briefly to popping-point in rapeseed oil before being added to the mix. I'm a longtime advocate of mustard seeds and in this instance they bring a lovely nutty flavour that really makes the dish."
  - "Counterintuitively, this coleslaw actually improves after sitting in the fridge for a day before eating. The raw cabbage and carrot benefit from this extra time to absorb the seasoning and will have more depth of flavour."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 1/4 red cabbage
    - 1 large carrot, peeled
    - 1/2 red onion, peeled
    - 2 tbsp rapeseed oil
    - 10 tbsp mayonnaise
    - 1 tsp white wine vinegar
    - sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
    - 1 small handful chives, finely chopped

method_steps:
  - "Remove the core from the cabbage and cut into fine slices and add to a large mixing bowl. Grate the carrot on the coarsest part of the grater. Remove the root from the onion and cut into thin slices, along the grain. Add the carrot and the onion to the bowl."
  - "Pour the rapeseed oil into a small pan and place over a medium-high heat. Wait for the oil to get hot (about 1 minute), then add the mustard seeds. When they begin to pop, remove from the heat and add both the seeds and rapeseed oil to the bowl. Add the mayonnaise, vinegar, and a three-finger-and-thumb pinch of sea salt and mix everything together. If you have time, leave it to sit in the fridge for a day before serving. Garnish with the chives."
