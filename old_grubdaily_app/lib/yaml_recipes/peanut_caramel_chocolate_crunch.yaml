summary: This Peanut Caramel slice is simple and delicious.

introduction:
  - "This is similar to the Peanut Millionaire's shortbread, but with a biscuit base instead of shortbread. I actually prefer it as it provides a crunchy texture constrast to the soft caramel on top, especially when kept in the fridge."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 150 g Hobnob biscuits (or Digestives)
    - 74 g salted butter
    - 45 g ground almonds
    - 200 g Peanut Caramel
    - 150 g dark chocolate

method_steps:
  - "Using a food processor, crush the biscuits into a breadcrumb-like consistency, and transfer to a mixing bowl. Add the ground almonds to the bowl. Melt the butter, add it to the bowl, and mix until thoroughly combined."
  - "Line a 20cm x 30cm baking tray with greaseproof paper and add the biscuit mixture. It should be approximately 5 - 10 mm in depth. Using the back of a spoon, press the biscuit evenly into the tray. Place in the fridge for 1 hour (or longer) to firm up."
  - "Soften the Peanut Caramel by warming it slightly, either in a plastic bowl in the microwave, or a saucepan on the stovetop. Pour the Peanut Caramel evenly over the biscuit base, then place in the fridge for 1 hour (or longer) to firm up."
  - "Break the chocolate into pieces, and place in a bowl (ideally a metal one). Melt the chocolate over a saucepan of simmering water, then pour evenly over the tray of biscuit base. Return to the fridge to set for 1 hour (or longer)."
  - "Release the biscuit from the its greaseproof paper lining and place on a chopping board. Using a sharp knife, cut into 24 pieces (4 x 6). The biscuit slices are best stored in the fridge, to keep them extra crunchy!"
