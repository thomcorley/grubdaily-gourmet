summary: This pesto is the perfect way to use up a glut of wild leeks

introduction:
  - "Pesto was the perfect way to preserve the big pile of wild leeks I picked at the weekend. There's a fresh garlicky flavour to them that's nicely balanced by the savoury and rich sweetness of the parmesan cheese. That, combined with the smoked bacon lardons, makes for a tasty bowl of food. This recipe will make enough pesto for several portions, so put any left overs in a jar and it will keep for at least a couple of weeks in the fridge."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 180 g dried tagliatelle pasta
    - 350 g wild leeks
    - 40 g pine nuts
    - 2 small clove garlic, roughly chopped
    - 50 g parmesan cheese, finely grated
    - 150 g extra virgin olive oil
    - 100 g smoked bacon lardons
    - 2 tsp butter
    - sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
    - vegetable oil, for cooking

method_steps:
  - "To make the pesto: firstly, roast the pine nuts in a dry pan or place under a grill until lightly browned, then set aside to cool. Wash the leeks thoroughly in cold water and remove any of the round fruit (they have a gummy texture and are not nice to eat). Cut off the flowers and the roots from the bulbs and discard. Take a small handful of leeks and set them aside, then roughly chop the remainder and place in a blender along with the garlic. Add the olive oil, and blend until you have a coarse paste. Add the pine nuts and continue blending until they're roughly chopped. Add the parmesan cheese and blend until just combined. Transfer the pesto into a bowl and give it a taste. Add some salt and pepper if you think it needs it."
  - "Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the packet, and while it's cooking, fry the bacon in a little vegetable oil until crisp then set aside in a bowl. Add the handful of leeks you set aside earlier to the pan you cooked the bacon in, and add the butter. Gently sauté the leeks over a medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until tender."
  - "When the pasta is cooked, drain it in a colander, making sure to reserve some of the pasta water. Put the pasta back into the pan, along with 60 g of the pesto. Add a few tablespoons of the pasta water and mix thoroughly until you have a nice sauce consistency. Serve in a bowl with the sautéed leeks and the bacon lardons on top."
