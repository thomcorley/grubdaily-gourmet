summary: This is a truly irresitible ice cream. The Peanut Caramel lends itself very well to a cream-based concoction such as this.

introduction:
  - "This is a truly irresitible ice cream. Peanut Caramel lends itself very well to a cream-based concoction such as this. We recommend serving it with some chopped roasted peanuts for a bit of crunch, and some fresh raspberries for juiciness, colour and a nod to the peanut butter and jam combo that we love so much."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 200 ml double cream
    - 100 ml milk
    - 150 g Peanut Caramel
    - 100 g caster sugar
    - 6 egg yolks

method_steps:
  - "In a pot, bring the double cream and milk to the boil, then add the Peanut Caramel. Whisk until fully incorporated, then remove from the heat."
  - "Place the caster sugar and egg yolks in a bowl, and whisk until smooth. Whilst continuing to whisk, slowly pour in about one third of the cream mixture, then pour the egg mixture into the pan with the rest of the cream, to combine everything."
  - "Slowly heat the pan of ice cream mix over a low heat, stirring constantly with a flat-ended wooden spoon or plastic spatula, to ensure it doesn't overcook at the bottom. Heat until the mixture coats the back of the spoon, or until it reaches a temperature of 75 C. Be careful not to overcook as you will scramble the eggs."
  - "Strain the mixture through a fine sieve, then cover with cling film on contact with the surface, to prevent a skin from forming. Once it's cooled to room temperature, place in the fridge. Churn in an ice cream machine. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed. Excellent served with some chopped roasted peanuts and fresh raspberries."
