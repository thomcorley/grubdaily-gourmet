introduction:
  - "Peanut Caramel goes well with apples (think toffee apple vibes), and the two together make a nice pancake topping.
     As per usual when it comes to apple desserts, we like Cox apples as they retain their texture nicely when cooked."

first_ingredient_set:
  for the pancakes:
    - 3 large eggs
    - 250 g plain flour
    - 450 ml milk
    - 1 pinch of sea salt
    - butter, for frying

second_ingredient_set:
  for the filling:
    - 3 cox apples, cored and sliced into half-rounds
    - butter, for frying
    - 100 g Peanut Caramel
    - 200 g double cream

method_steps:
  - "Crack the eggs into a bowl, add the flour, a splash of the milk and salt. Mix until you have a perfectly smooth consistency. Now add the rest of the milk in stages, mixing to get a smooth texture in between each stage."
  - "To cook the pancakes, get your frying pan nice and hot before adding a knob of butter. Once the butter has melted, pour in a ladleful of batter whilst carefully tilting the pan to ensure that a nice even spread is achieved. Fry for a few minutes on each side, until golden. Put on a plate in a low oven or plate warmer tray to keep warm whilst you cook the rest of the batch."
  - "To prepare the apples, place a wide, heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat and add a generous knob of butter. Add the sliced apples and stir-and fry for 3 minutes. They should be part-cooked only, still with some bite to them. Remove from the pan and set aside. In the same pan, add the double cream and Peanut Caramel. Bring to the boil, then remove from the heat and whisk until smooth. Now return the apples to the pan and stir to combine."
  - "To serve, simply place a portion of the apples on each pancake, ensuring each gets a generous amount of the Peanut Caramel sauce. If the sauce seems a bit too thick, you can thin it with a little milk or water."
