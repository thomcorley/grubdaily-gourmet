summary:

introduction:
  - "The vibrant colors in this dish make it appropriate for the season, somehow, and it would be perfect for a light starter for Christmas dinner. I made some [cured salmon](https://www.grubdaily.com/cured-salmon-jersey-royals) earlier in the year, which turned out great, and since farmed salmon is in constant supply year-round, I see no reason not to be curing salmon more often! It's so easy to do, and much, much cheaper than buying your own."
  - "I didn't cure this one though – it was a gift from my friend Prof. He had cured a whole side and had too much to eat. I was more than happy to help him out! It was beautifully cured; not too salty which home-cured products often are. If you contact him on his [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/grapeman_euan/), maybe he'll give you the recipe."
  - "For this recipe, I'll assume you have sourced your own cured salmon from somewhere. If you can't find beetroot cured salmon then gravlax or smoked salmon will suffice."
