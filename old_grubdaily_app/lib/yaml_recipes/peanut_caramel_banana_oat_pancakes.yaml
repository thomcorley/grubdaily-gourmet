introduction:
  - "This is a really simple pancake recipe consisting of only 4 core ingredients. It's also super easy if you have a blender – just add blend all the ingredients until smooth and you're good to go. In terms of garnishing, you could have them with anything sweet, but obviously we would recommend Peanut Caramel. The rich peanutty flavour goes particularly well with banana, and the little hint of cinnamon is very complimentary."

first_ingredient_set:
  for the pancakes:
    - 2 medium bananas
    - 100 g porridge oats
    - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
    - 2 medium eggs
    - 1 pinch salt (optional)
    - butter, for frying

second_ingredient_set:
  for the filling and topping:
    - 150 ml double cream
    - 75 g Peanut Caramel
    - 1 medium banana, sliced
    - 4 tbsp salted roasted peanuts

method_steps:
  - "To make the pancake batter, put the 2 bananas, porridge oats, cinnamon and eggs in a blender and blend until smooth."
  - "Roughly chop or crush the salted peanuts and fry them with a little butter until golden, then set aside for later."
  - "Fry the pancakes – melt a knob of butter in a frying pan and wait for it to melt, then add the batter 1 tablespoon at a time, spreading it gently to form a circular pancake about 0.5 cm thick. Fry on a medium heat for 2 minutes on each side, or until golden. Cook the pancakes in batches, and keep warm in a low oven or plate warmer."
  - "To make the Peanut Caramel sauce, add the double cream and Peanut Caramel to a sauce pan and bring to the boil over a medium heat whilst whisking. Once it's boiling, remove from the heat and continue to whisk until smooth."
  - "To serve the pancakes, stack them up with sliced bananas and Peanut Caramel sauce between the layers and scatter some of the chopped roasted peanuts on top."
