introduction:
  - "This rather special pasta dish is based on a rich, creamy shellfish sauce (similar to a _bisque_), that requires a bit of time and effort to get right. You may have to go out of your way to source the ingredients, too; you'll need either lobster, langoustine or prawn shells. All this extra effort is completely worth it though, it's so delicious!"
  - "The key to getting a nice consistency of sauce for this dish relies on two things: a good quality chicken stock that has body to it and will thicken when reduced, and double cream which, again, will thicken when reduced. I would suggest making your own chicken stock for this, using chicken wings."
