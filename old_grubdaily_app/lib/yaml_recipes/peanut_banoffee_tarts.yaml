summary: These little peanut banoffee tarts are very simple and very delicious

introduction:
  - "These little peanut banoffee tarts are very simple and very delicious. The base is the same as our standard cheesecake base; butter, crushed Hobnobs and a little ground almonds. You can use Digestives biscuits instead, but Hobnobs are tastier and crunchier. If you like, you could make a big batch of the circular bases and store them in the freezer, waiting to be made into a delicious and quick dessert at a moment's notice. If you're short for time, a whole Digestive or Hobnob biscuits will serve as a reasonable substitute."
  - "For this recipe you'll need some round cutters or crumpet rings, approx 8cm in diameter. Optional: if you have a piping bag with a star-shaped nozzle, it makes the whipped cream topping look more professional."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 150 g Hobnob biscuits (or Digestives)
    - 65 g salted butter
    - 50 g ground almonds
    - 8 tbsp Peanut Caramel
    - 2 medium bananas, peeled and sliced
    - 200 ml double cream
    - 50 g caster sugar
    - dark chocolate, for garnishing

method_steps:
  - "Crush the biscuits to a breadcrumb-like consistency and place in a mixing bowl along with the ground almonds. Melt the butter, add it to the bowl and mix until incorporated."
  - "To make the buscuit bases, line a tray or baking sheet with parchment paper, and place a 8cm round cutter or crumpet ring on it. Spoon the biscuit mixture into the cutter and press with the back of a spoon until smooth. It should be about 5 mm deep. Carefully lift the cutter/ring and repeat until you've used all of the biscuit mixture. Place the tray in the fridge for 1 hour to allow the biscuit bases to firm up."
  - "Place the caster sugar and double cream into a mixing bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form. Transfer to a piping bag with a star-shaped nozzle (optional)."
  - "When the bases are nice and firm, spread each with 1 tbsp of Peanut Caramel, then top with a few slices of banana."
  - "Apply a generous amount of whipped cream to each, and finally top with a few gratings of dark chocolate."
