summary: Grouse goes well with root vegetables, and especially with the sweetness of beetroot

introduction:
  - "Grouse is the true king of all the game birds. The season officially begins on the 12th of August in the U.K. and because it's the first of any game meat to come into season, it's held in high esteem. Each year I look forward to cooking grouse for my loved ones. Every year I had always followed the same formula: roast the bird, roast some vegetables (including some potatoes) and serve it with some grouse sauce from the freezer saved from the previous year's grouse season. This routine was becoming a bit repetitive and boring, so I decided to do something a little different this year."
  - "Beetroot is a nice accompaniment for grouse because its sweet earthy flavour combines beautifully with the strong flavour of the grouse. The crunchy, slightly sharp-flavoured walnuts really improve the whole experience too. I would usually have served the legs whole on the side, which is fine, but they are small and bitty to eat. This time I instead cooked them as a confit, then flaked the meat off the bone, mixed with chopped fried hearts and liver, and served on a little piece of toast. It was truly delicious and this is how I'll be preparing my grouse legs from now on."
  - "A word on the sauce. It's a true chicken and egg situation: you need grouse carcasses to make the sauce, but you need to roast the grouse on the bone before you have any carcasses. You could remove the breasts from the grouse, then make the sauce with the raw carcasses before cooking the breast on its own, but you will end up with a somewhat inferior end result. There is nothing more satisfying than cooking the bird perfectly on the bone and carving it to reveal the soft pink mini fillet inside (this is impossible to achieve unless you cook the grouse whole, on the bone). You could remove the wings and/or the legs from the bird and make sauce with those, but then you can't use them for the confit. The only respectable way to get around this problem is to roast the bird, carve the breasts off, wrapping them in some kitchen foil or a butter paper, then chop up the carcass and make the sauce as quickly as possible whilst keeping the breast meat warm. The serve. With a bit of luck you'll have more than enough sauce and you have a head start for next time."
  - "Buy your grouse 'oven ready', meaning that it has been plucked and had its innards removed, but ideally including the hearts and liver. This is usually how you'll find them in a typical butchers shop. If you have no hearts or liver you can do the toast with the confit leg meat only, which will still be excellent. I would also advise covering the breast meat in bacon and tying with butcher's twine, this will protect the tender meat and prevent it from overcooking, as well as imparting a bit of extra flavour."
