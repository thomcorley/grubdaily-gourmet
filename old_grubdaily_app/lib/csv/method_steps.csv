1,"Heat the oven to 200C/  Gas mark 6. Start by making the tomato sauce: gently fry the garlic in olive oil until it is just starting to colour, then add the tomatoes and basil. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer until the sauce is thick and rich; around 20 minutes (longer if your tinned tomatoes are very watery)."
1,"Divide the sauce between individual gratin dishes, or alternatively put it all into the bottom of a large dish. Now arrange overlapping layers of courgette and tomato, and then a sprinkle of cheese. Repeat with more layers until the dishes are full, finishing with a layer of cheese on top."
1,"Place in the oven and bake, with the lid on (use foil if you don’t have a lid), for 20 minutes. Remove the lid and bake for a further 20 minutes, or until golden and crispy on top."
,
2,Place a large pot over a medium heat and fry the bacon until it starts to go crispy. Then add the onion and garlic and fry until soft.
2,"Now add the tomatoes, flageolet beans, pesto and a good sprinke of black pepper. Bring to the boil and simmer gently, with the lid on for 15 minutes."
2,"Add the courgettes, and simmer uncovered until they are tender; 5-10 minutes. Brilliant served with crusty white bread, or jacket potatoes."
,
3,"To make the dressing, get a shallow bowl and whisk in it the Dijon mustard, garlic and vinegar. Then gradually whisk in the oil to make an emulsified dressing. Season to taste with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside."
3,"Now arrange the tomatoes on a plate and scatter over the shallots and capers. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Whisk a little water into the dressing to thin it out a bit, then drizzle over the salad, topping it off with a sprinkle of parsley."
,
4,"Firstly, in large deep pan, fry the bacon in olive oil until slightly crispy. Then add the onion, garlic, celery and carrot and fry gently with the lid slightly on for around 15mins until nice and soft. This intensifies all the flavours and makes an excellent base for the soup."
4,"Now add to the pan the tomatoes, courgettes and red wine, bring to the boil and simmer for another 10 mins or so."
4,"Add the spinach, stock, beans and pasta. Continue to simmer until the pasta is cooked. If the soup seems too thick, you can add more stock."
,
5,"Preheat the oven to 190/Gas mark 5. While the oven is heating; peel and chop your butternut squash. Toss in a roasting tray with a glug of olive oil and some salt and pepper and pop in the oven for 30 minutes. In the meantime, get on with the risotto."
5,"Heat a couple of good glugs of olive oil in a wide-based, deep pan. Add the onion, garlic and celery and gently fry over a low heat with the lid on -slightly ajar- for about 15 minutes."
5,Heat your stock and have it simmering in a pan next to your risotto pan.
5,"Prepare the chanterelles: heat a large saucepan until it is very hot, then throw in the chanterelles and toss them until they are tender - this will only take a minute or so. The mushrooms must sit in a single layer in the pan - do them in batches if need be. Toss them in a bowl with some salt and pepper and set aside."
5,"Add the risotto rice, turn up the heat a bit, and stir and cook for a minute. Add the wine, and stir until the liquid has been absorbed. Now add the stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring until each one has been absorbed before adding the next. You must stir frequently to prevent it sticking to the bottom of the pan and to slowly massage the starch out of the rice, creating a beautiful creamy sauce."
,
6,"In a wide-based pot, gently fry the finely chopped onion, garlic, ginger and chilli over a low heat for about 10 minutes until the onion is soft."
6,"Add the tomatoes and the sliced onion and cook through for about 2 minutes. Add the spices, and cook for a minute. "
6,"Now add the lamb mince, turn the heat up and stir constantly until the meat is uniformly browned."
6,"Turn the heat down, and let it all simmer gently whilst you prepare your potatoes. Peel them, then chop them into approximately 1 inch cubes. Try to get the size constant, so that they cook at the same rate."
6,"Add the potatoes to the pot, along with the water. Place the lid on, and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender."
6,"Just before serving, roughly chop the coriander and add it to the pot. Heat through and serve."
,
7,To prepare the yeast: blend the fresh yeast in the warm water. Alternatively dissolve 1 teaspoon of caster sugar in the water and then sprinkle in 1.5 teaspoons of dried yeast. Leave for about 10 minutes or until the mixture is frothy.
7,Melt the butter and set aside.
7,"Mix the plain white flour with the salt in a bowl. Add the yeast mixture and the melted butter and mix to form a dough. Turn onto a floured work surface and knead for about 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic."
7,"Place the dough in an oiled plastic bag and leave to rise for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size."
7,Knock the air out of the risen dough by kneading again for 2 minutes or until it is firm. Cover and leave to rest for 5 minutes.
7,"On a floured surface, roll the dough out to 1cm thickness. Cover again and leave for 5 minutes."
7,"With a plain cutter, cut the dough into approx. 9cm rounds. Place on a well floured baking sheet and dust the tops with fine semolina or polenta. Cover and prove in a warm place until they have doubled in size - about 20-30 minutes."
7,"To cook: heat a griddle, or heavy frying pan and grease it lightly. Cook the muffins for about 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Place on a wire rack to cool."
,
8,Heat the butter in a saucepan and add the onions and garlic. Cook gently for about 5 minutes without colouring.
8,"Add the curry powder and red chilli, along with the stock, and bring to the boil."
8,"Add the parsnips, potato and coconut and simmer with the lid on for 20-25 minutes or until the vegetables are tender."

8,"For garnish: try a swirl of double cream, and a sprinkle of smoked paprika. Or finely chopped red pepper and chives."
,
9,Slice the onions and put them into a large pot along with all of the remaining ingredients.
9,"Bring to the boil and simmer with the lid off for 2-3 hours, depending on how fluid you want your chutney to be."
9,"If you want a well-set product, test it by spooning some of the liquid onto a saucer in the fridge and leave it for 5 minutes."
9,"When it has finished simmering, remove from the heat and let it cool before spooning into jam jars and store."
,
10,"Grind the annatto seeds, cumin seeds, peppercorns, cloves and allspice in a spice grinder until a fine powder is achieved."
10,"Put the spices into a large bowl in which you will marinate the meat. Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl, including the chunks of pork, and mix well. "
10,"Leave to marinate for 4-6 hours, preferably overnight."
10,"Heat an oven to 165C/Gas mark 3. Line a roasting tin with banana leaves, if available. Pour in the meat along with the marinate, cover and cook for 4 hours. Just before serving, remove from oven and sprinkle over another tablespoon of dark brown sugar."
10,Serve with fluffy white rice.
,
11,Put the kettle on to boil for the pasta. Fry the bacon in olive oil in a large frying pan or pot (it will need to be big enough to mix the pasta and the sauce together before serving).
11,"Get a pan of boiling water, add plenty of salt and a glug of olive oil and keep it simmering."
11,"When the bacon just starts to turn crispy, add the spaghetti to the boiling water."
11,"When the bacon is nice and crispy, add the onion and garlic to the pan along with a knob of butter. Turn down the heat and leave to cook gently."
11,"Now make your sauce: in a jug, whisk the eggs, cream, parmesan and black pepper. "
11,"When the pasta is al dente, drain it, reserving some of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the pan with the bacon and stir briefly (this helps to cool everything down slightly to avoid scrambling the eggs)."
11,"Now pour in the egg-cream mixture and mix everything together thoroughly. The residual heat from the pasta and bacon will gently cook the eggs and melt the cheese, resulting in an amazingly rich creamy sauce. Add some of the cooking water to achieve a more fluid consistency. Keep stirring until the sauce is silky and smooth, then serve and eat immediately."
,
13,"Make the honeyed oats; toast the oats in a dry pan until lightly coloured. Add 2 tablespoons of the honey and a pinch of sea salt, stir until reduced and the oats forms clusters. Transfer to a tray and leave to cool."
13,Take half of the raspberries and place in a pan with the remaining 2 tablespoons of honey. Stir over a high heat to make a sort of compôt. Bring to the boil then remove and allow to cool.
13,"Place the sugar, cream and whisky in a bowl and whisk until soft peaks form. Mix in the whole raspberries, saving a few back for garnish, about half of the raspberry compote, and most of the honeyed oats, saving some for garnish. Fold everything together to create a marble effect, then serve into bowls, finishing with the whole raspberries, honeyed oats and compote. Finally dust a little icing sugar over the top."
,
14,"Fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil. Season generously with salt (it should be almost as salty as the sea.) Drop the crab in the water, bring back to the boil, remove from the heat and allow to cool for at least 40 minutes. Remove the crab from the water, and place on a tray."
14,"Break off the claws, and smash them carefully with a hammer or large knife, trying not to smash into too many small pieces. Separate the meat from the shell, trying to keep it in nice big chunks. Repeat the process with the legs. Now prise the body from the main shell of the crab, and remove and discard the lungs (“dead man’s fingers”). Cut the body in half and carefully scrape out the meat with a crab picker or use the handle of a teaspoon. Cut the pieces in half again and scrape more out - you’ll be surprised how much is hidden in all the cavities. Carefully check the crab meat for pieces of shell, cover and place in the fridge."
14,"Heat the oven to 200C. Place a roasting tray in the oven until very hot, then add 3-4 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Smash all the crab shell into small pieces with a heavy knife or rolling pin, then place in the roasting tray. Stir once, then return to the oven for 30 minutes, stirring halfway."
14,"Meanwhile, thinly slice all the vegetables, keeping the carrots separate. In a large pot, fry the carrots and star anise in a little vegetable oil with a generous pinch of salt, until lightly coloured. Add the rest of the vegetables and sweat over a medium heat for about 20 minutes.The shells should be lightly coloured. Deglaze the tray with the white wine, and reduce until dry. Add the shells to the pot of vegetables, and the tomato, roughly chopped. Add the cream to the pot, and bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 30 minutes, then roughly chop the herbs (reserving some chives and dill for the salad) and add to the pot. Cover with cling film and leave to infuse for 30 minutes."
14,"Pass the crab cream through a fine sieve, rinsing the shell pulp with the milk. Discard the pulp. Taste the cream and adjust the seasoning if it needs. Weigh the cream, and then place 1 egg yolk for every 100g of cream in a separate pan. Boil the cream, then pour slowly over the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Now heat the crab custard over a low heat, stirring constantly with a plastic spatula to ensure it doesn’t stick. When it is thick, and coats the back of the spatula (should be 80C), it is ready. Pour into 6 wide crème brûlée dishes, filling only to 2mm deep. You may have some custard left over which you can just set in separate ramekins to be enjoyed on their own. Place the ramekins in the fridge to set, for at least two hours."
14,"To make the crab salad: finely slice the lettuce and the spring onion, cut the reserved chives and pick the dill into fronds. Place everything in a bowl with the picked crab meat, the croutons and add just enough mayonnaise to lightly bind it together; you may not need all of it, it depends on how much crab meat you have. Season with sea salt if it needs, and lemon juice. Divide the mixture into 6 and place in the middle of the custard ramekins. Finally sprinkle over a little cayenne pepper."
,
15,"Lightly toast the bagels, fry the bacon until crispy. Peel the avocado, remove the stone and cut into slices. Season the slices with sea salt, black pepper, olive oil and lime juice. Give half an avocado per portion. Layer the fillings generously, as shown in the photo."

Reserve 3 cloves for the garnish later, then cut the tops off the bulbs of garlic so the tips of the cloves are poking out, then add to the roasting tray along with the rosemary and roast for about 45 minutes until the garlic is completely soft and oozing out of its skins."
16,"Meanwhile finely slice the onion and sweat in a medium pot with olive oil, and a pinch of sea salt. Cook over a medium heat for about 25 minutes until the onion is soft, sweet and slightly caramelised. Peel the potato and finely slice it. Add to the pot and continue to cook, stirring occasionally. Squeeze the garlic out of its skins and add the soft pulp to the pot along with the cream and brown chicken stock. Simmer gently for 20 minutes, then pour everything into a food processor and blend until completely puréed and silky smooth. If it’s a little too thick, add a splash of chicken stock."
16,"To garnish the soup, finely slice the 3 reserved garlic cloves with a sharp knife (or a mandolin, if you have one) and sauté in a little olive oil until they are lightly coloured. Be careful as they will taste bitter if you let them get too dark. Scatter these over the soup along with some finely chopped chives."
,
17,"Make the pastry: mix the flour with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Cut the butter into small dice and rub into the flour with your fingertips until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the water and mix until you have a soft dough. Knead briefly, but don't overwork as this will develop the gluten causing the pastry to be less crisp. Divide into however many portions you are making, flatten into discs, wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Roll the pastry discs into circles 2mm thick; they should be 1 inch wider in diameter than the tart cases. Carefully line the tart cases and press into the edges ensuring it is an even thickness all around. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 200C."
17,"Blind bake the pastry by lining with foil, then filling with dried beans or rice, making sure it is packed all the way into the corners. Place in the oven for 10 minutes, then turn down to 170C and bake for a further 10 minutes, or until the outside of the pastry is light golden. Now remove the foil packets and return to the oven for a further 10-15 minutes, until the pastry is golden and crisp, inside and out. This may take a bit longer depending on your oven. Remove and allow to cook on a rack."
17,"Once the pastry is cool, fill each pastry case with 2-3 tablespoons of red onion chutney, and 3 slices of goat's cheese. Pick some individual thyme leaves and scatter over the cheese, then place under the grill to gently melt. Garnish with the spinach leaves, dressed lightly with olive oil. Serve with a nice salad."
,
18,"Place the Arbroath smokies, thyme and bay in a large shallow pan and cover with the milk. Bring to the boil, cover and leave to infuse for 30 minutes. In the meantime thinly slice the onion, garlic, and the white part of the leeks. Heat about 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium pan and slowly fry the vegetables for about 20 minutes, until soft. Peel and thinly slice ¾ of the potato and add to the pan. Dice the rest of the potato into 5mm cubes and set aside to be sautéed for the garnish."
18,"Remove the smokies from the milk and carefully pick the meat away from the bone, discarding the skin. Set the flaked fish aside. Pass the milk through a sieve into the pan of vegetables. Add the cream, and simmer gently for 10 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked. Pour everything into a blender, add ¾ of the flaked smokies and the butter and blend on full power for 5 minutes, until the soup is very smooth and silky. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary."

18,"Garnish the soup with thinly sliced spring onions, the remainder of the flaked smokies, and the sautéed potato dice."
,
19,"To make crispy aubergine slices, you need to remove most of the water from the aubergine. It’s like a sponge, and holds a lot of moisture. Slice them and salt them to draw it out. This way they will go nice and crisp when you bake them."
19,"Heat the oven to 180C. Gently squeeze out the liquid from the aubergine slices, being careful not to break them. Arrange them on a baking tray and flatten them out. Sprinkle with a little black pepper, but no salt. Drizzle with olive oil and bake in the oven for about 15 minutes, turning them over halfway, until they are golden and crisp. Remove from the oven and leave to drain on some kitchen paper."
19,"To assemble the salad: slice the tomato into 2mm slices and season each slice with sea salt, cracked black pepper and olive oil. Arrange the aubergine slices alternating with the tomato as shown in the photo. Garnish with basil leaves, parmesan shavings and balsamic vinegar."
,
20,"Pour boiling water onto dates, add bicarb and leave to soak."
20,"Cream butter and sugar until smooth, add eggs and combine."
20,"Sift flour and baking powder into egg mix, stir until flour is completely mixed through."
20,"Mix in the date mixture, add espresso then pour everything into a baking tray/cake tin and bake at about 180C for roughly 40mins. (It's hard to say the exact time) It's done when you stick a skewer into the middle and it only just comes out with no raw mixture stuck to it."
,
21,"Set 12 mushrooms aside, and slice the rest of them in half. Sprinkle the halved mushrooms with the sea salt so they're evenly covered, then place in a colander set over a bowl. Leave in the fridge for about 6 hours, or overnight."
21,"Heat the oven to 180C, and put a medium sized roasting tray in to heat up. Briefly rinse the mushrooms with cold water, then squeeze them with your hands to remove as much moisture as possible. Pat them dry with kitchen paper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in the roasting tray, then add the mushrooms along with 2 sprigs of rosemary. Roast the mushrooms, tossing occasionally, until they are dark and caramelised."
21,"Meanwhile, thinly slice the onion and garlic, and dice the bacon. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium pot and fry the bacon over a high heat until crisp. Turn the heat down and sweat the onion and garlic slowly for about 20 minutes, until soft and sweet. Once the mushrooms are nicely coloured, remove the rosemary from the roasting tray and add the mushrooms to the pan of onions. Add about 1 litre of chicken stock - enough to just cover the mushrooms - and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover with a lid, and simmer for 30 minutes, topping up with chicken stock when it reduces too much. Blend the soup in a food processor on full power for 5 minutes, until you have a silky smooth texture. You may need to add a little more stock to get the required consistency."
21,"To finish; slice the 12 reserved mushrooms in half, season with salt and sauté them to get a nice roasted colour. Pick the leaves from the remaining rosemary sprig and fry these in olive oil until just crisp. Scatter the mushrooms and rosemary over the soup along with a drizzle of olive oil."
,
22,"Carefully remove the bone from the short saddle, being careful not to leave any of the meat attached to the bone. Trim off the skin from the layer of fat, being very careful not to make any holes in the flap, as we need this intact in order to wrap around the loins. You now have 2 pieces of loin with a flap of fat attached to each. Place the layer of fat on a chopping board and bash it out with the flat part of a heavy knife, to flatten the fat to a nice thin layer. Again, be careful not to make any holes. Place the loins in the fridge."
22,"Get a medium pan hot on the stove, and sauté the spinach with a pinch of salt until gently wilted. Transfer to a colander and leave to chill in the fridge. Meanwhile, finely chop the shallot and garlic and sweat slowly in olive oil until soft. Transfer to a bowl. Roughly chop the black olive and add to the bowl. Now take the lamb kidneys and remove the outer membrane. Cut in half lengthways and cut out the white gristle from inside. Cut the kidneys into 5mm dice, then fry in a hot pan until lightly coloured. Remove, and add to the bowl with the shallots, garlic and olive. Once the spinach is cold, squeeze all the remaining moisture from it by wringing in your hands.

Carefully line the ring with the pastry, being careful to press evenly into the sides and corners. Leave about an inch of pastry hanging over the edge. This will help prevent it from shrinking inwards when baking. Reserve trimmings for patching any cracks in the pastry later. Heat the oven to 190 C. Place the pastry shell in the fridge or freezer for at least 20 minutes before cooking."
32,"Now line the pastry with a round of parchment paper and fill with dried beans or rice, pressing gently to fill the shell completely. Blind-bake the pastry for 35 to 45 minutes, until the outside of the pastry is golden and crisp but the inside still light.

Mix with the cooked leeks. For the batter, heat the milk, cream and salt in a pan until a skin just begins to form on the surface. Place 3 eggs, half the cream mixture, 3 gratings of nutmeg and half the white pepper in a blender and blitz for about 30 seconds until foamy and light. Spread out half the leek mixture and half the roquefort in the bottom of the quiche shell, and pour over enough batter to just cover. Repeat with the remaining filling and batter mix. Fill the quiche to the very brim. Reserve any left over filling. Carefully place in the oven being careful not to spill any of the mix. Cook for about 1 ½ hours, until the quiche is nicely brown and the custard just set when jiggled. After about 20 minutes the custard will have sunk slightly in the middle as some of the air escapes the mix; simply top up with the leftover batter and return to the oven. Refrigerate for at least a day, or up to 3 days, until completely set. Slice into portions and reheat gently in the oven. Alternatively, it is just as excellent eaten cold."
