In my mind, cooking and eating are two parts of the same thing. The purpose of cooking or preparing a piece of food is to make it more delicious  before you eat it, and this process is inextricably tied to the sense of taste. Cooking should involve continuously tasting the food to ensure that what you're creating is as delicious as it can be."

I've now left the world of restaurants, but my love of food has not diminished; I actually enjoy cooking more, now, outside of the professional kitchen environment. I started grubdaily.com in 2010, just before the start of my chef career and have developed it over the years into what is now an invaluable repository of food content. I hope you enjoy."
